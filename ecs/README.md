## ejabberd Community Server - Base

This ejabberd Docker image allows you to run a single node ejabberd instance in a Docker container.

## Running ejabberd

### Default configuration for domain localhost

You can run ejabberd in a new container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --name ejabberd -d -p 5222:5222 ejabberd/ecs
```

This command will run Docker image as a daemon, using ejabberd default configuration file and XMPP domain "localhost".

To stop the running container, you can run:

```bash
docker stop ejabberd
```

If needed you can restart the stopped ejabberd container with:

```bash
docker restart ejabberd
```

### Creating admin user

When the container is running (and thus ejabberd), you can exec commands inside the container. The api command-line tool can be used to exercise the API directly from the container, even if the API is not exposed to the outside world. Note: ejabberd configuration must allow api calls from loopback interface.

To create an admin user (or any other user), you can use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it ejabberd bin/ejabberdapi register --endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:5280/ --jid=admin@localhost --password=passw0rd
```

It's also possible to fallback to ejabberdctl commands:

```bash
docker exec -it ejabberd bin/ejabberdctl register admin localhost passw0rd
```

### Running ejabberd with Erlang console attached

If you would like to run it with Erlang console attached you can use the `live` command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 5222:5222 ejabberd/ecs live
```

This command will use default configuration file and XMPP domain "localhost".

### Running ejabberd with your config file and database host directory

The following command will pass config file using Docker volume feature and share local directory to store database:

```bash
mkdir database
docker run -d --name ejabberd -v $(pwd)/ejabberd.yml:/home/ejabberd/conf/ejabberd.yml -v $(pwd)/database:/home/ejabberd/database -p 5222:5222 ejabberd/ecs
```

### Checking ejabberd log files

You can execute a Docker command to check the content of the log files from inside to container, even if you do not put it on a shared persistent drive:

```bash
docker exec -it ejabberd tail -f logs/ejabberd.log
```

### Open ejabberd debug console

You can open a live debug Erlang console attached to a running container:

```bash
docker exec -it ejabberd bin/ejabberdctl debug
```

### Execute ejabberdctl command

You can run any ejabberdctl command inside running container. Example:

```bash
docker exec -it ejabberd bin/ejabberdctl status
```

## Docker image advanced configuration

### Ports

ejabberd base Docker image exposes the following port:

- 5222: This is the default XMPP port for clients.
- 5280: This is the port for admin interface, API, Websockets and XMPP BOSH.
- 5269: Optional. This is the port for XMPP federation. Only needed if you want to communicate with users on other servers.

### Volumes

ejabberd produces two types of data: log files and database (Mnesia).
This is the kind of data you probably want to store on a persistent or local drive (at least the database).

Here are the volume you may want to map:

- /home/ejabberd/logs/: Directory containing log files
- /home/ejabberd/database/: Directory containing Mnesia database. You should back up or export the content of the directory to persistent storage (host storage, local storage, any storage plugin)
- /home/ejabberd/conf/: Directory containing configuration and certificates
- /usr/src/ejabberd/sql: Directory containing SQL install scripts

All these files are owned by ejabberd user inside the container. Corresponding
UID:GID is 9000:9000. If you prefer bind mounts instead of docker volumes, then
you need to map this to valid UID:GID on your host to get read/write access on
mounted directories.

## Generating ejabberd release

### Configuration

Image is build by embedding an ejabberd Erlang/OTP standalone release in the image.

The configuration of ejabberd Erlang/OTP release is customized with:

- rel/config.exs: Customize ejabberd release
- rel/dev.exs: ejabberd environment configuration for development release
- rel/prod.exs: ejabberd environment configuration for production Docker release
- vars.config: ejabberd compilation configuration options
- conf/ejabberd.yml: ejabberd default config file

Build ejabberd Community Server base image from ejabberd master on Github:

```bash
docker build -t ejabberd/ecs .
```

Build ejabberd Community Server base image for a given ejabberd version:

```bash
./build.sh 18.03
```

### TODO

- Rebuild last version of bin/ejabberdapi tool when creating container.
